# Security Guidelines for Brand2Stand POP Display Design Automation App

This document outlines the security principles, controls, and best practices to ensure the Brand2Stand POP Display Design Automation App is built and operated securely by design.

## 1. Security Principles

- **Security by Design**: Embed security at every phase—requirements, design, implementation, testing, and deployment.
- **Least Privilege**: Grant users, services, and database roles only the permissions strictly necessary for their functionality.
- **Defense in Depth**: Apply multiple overlapping controls so that a single failure does not compromise the system.
- **Fail Securely**: On errors, degrade functionality safely without exposing sensitive data or leaving open access.
- **Simplicity & Maintainability**: Keep security controls clear and easy to audit and update.
- **Secure Defaults**: Configure all components (APIs, database, libraries) with the most restrictive settings out of the box.

## 2. Authentication & Authorization

### 2.1 Supabase Authentication

- Enforce **HTTPS/TLS** for all Supabase auth endpoints.
- Use Supabase’s JWT tokens with:
  - Strong secret keys stored in a secrets manager (e.g., Vercel environment variables, HashiCorp Vault).
  - Short-lived tokens (e.g., 15–30 min) and rotate refresh tokens securely.
- Enable **MFA** (OTP or authenticator apps) for privileged or admin users.
- Avoid storing tokens or PII in localStorage; use secure, HttpOnly, `SameSite=Strict` cookies.

### 2.2 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Define roles (`user`, `admin`) in Supabase policies. Grant table-level permissions accordingly:
  - **Users** can only read/write *their own* projects.
  - **Admins** have read/write/delete on all data.
- Implement server-side enforcement via Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies. Do not trust client-side checks alone.

## 3. Input Validation & Output Encoding

### 3.1 Form Inputs

- Validate all fields on the server:
  - Strings: length, allowed characters (no control characters).
  - Enumerations: stand type, materials, dimensions within safe ranges.
- Reject unexpected or missing fields.
- Use a schema validation library (e.g., Zod, Joi) before business logic.

### 3.2 Injection Prevention

- Supabase uses parameterized queries; do not build raw SQL with string concatenation.
- For any direct SQL usage, always use prepared statements.

### 3.3 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- Escape/encode user-supplied content in React using built-in escaping (avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`).
- If HTML input is required, sanitize with a library (e.g., DOMPurify) and enforce a strict Content Security Policy (CSP).

---

## 4. Data Protection & Privacy

### 4.1 Encryption

- **In Transit**: TLS 1.2+ enforced for all client–server and server–server communications.
- **At Rest**: Supabase database storage is encrypted by default. Ensure backups and storage buckets (if used) are also encrypted.

### 4.2 Secrets Management

- Do **not** commit API keys (Fal.ai, OpenAI, Supabase) to source control.
- Store secrets in a secure vault or CI/CD environment variables. Rotate keys periodically.

### 4.3 Sensitive Data Minimization

- Only store necessary PII (e.g., email). Do not store password equivalents—Supabase handles hashing with bcrypt.
- Mask or redact any sensitive logs. Avoid stack traces or internal errors reaching the client.

---

## 5. API & Service Security

### 5.1 HTTPS & CORS

- Enforce HTTPS on all API endpoints.
- Configure CORS to allow only the approved frontend origin(s).

### 5.2 Rate Limiting & Throttling

- Implement rate limits on critical endpoints (image generation, prompt enhancement) to prevent abuse and DoS.
- Leverage Supabase’s extension or an API gateway for global throttling.

### 5.3 Authentication & Authorization

- Every API call must validate the JWT and check the user’s permissions before accessing or mutating data.
- Reject requests missing or presenting invalid/expired tokens.

## 6. Web Application Security Hygiene

### 6.1 CSRF Protection

- All state-changing operations (e.g., saving a project) require anti-CSRF tokens.
- For cookie-based sessions, use the **synchronizer token pattern** or verify the `Origin`/`Referer` header.

### 6.2 Security Headers

Configure the following HTTP headers:
- `Content-Security-Policy`: Restrict script, style, and frame sources.
- `Strict-Transport-Security`: Enforce HTTPS (e.g., `max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`).
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`.
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.

### 6.3 Secure Cookies

- Set `HttpOnly` to prevent JavaScript access.
- Set `Secure` to ensure cookies only sent over HTTPS.
- Use `SameSite=Lax` or `Strict` to mitigate CSRF.

---

## 7. Infrastructure & Configuration Management

### 7.1 Server Hardening

- Disable unused ports and services on hosting platforms (Vercel/Netlify manage this by default).
- Remove default credentials; enforce unique, strong passwords for any admin consoles.

### 7.2 TLS Configuration

- Use modern cipher suites (AES-GCM, ChaCha20) and disable weak protocols (SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0/1.1).

### 7.3 Environment Isolation

- Separate development, staging, and production environments with distinct credentials and databases.
- Audit environment variable usage and avoid sharing secrets across environments.

---

## 8. Dependency Management

- Maintain a lockfile (`package-lock.json`) to ensure reproducible builds.
- Vet and update dependencies regularly; integrate a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot) to detect CVEs.
- Minimize dependencies to reduce attack surface.

---

## 9. DevOps & CI/CD Security

- Use GitHub Actions with least-privilege tokens; store secrets in GitHub Secrets.
- Fail CI on linting/security scanning failures (ESLint, SCA tool).
- Deploy only from reviewed and merged pull requests.
- Keep build tools and container images up to date.

---

## 10. Monitoring & Incident Response

- Enable logging of authentication events, failed login attempts, and suspicious API usage.
- Integrate alerting for high error rates or unusual request patterns.
- Establish an incident response plan: triage, contain, eradicate, recover, and post-mortem analysis.

Adherence to these guidelines will help ensure that the Brand2Stand application remains secure, resilient, and trustworthy throughout its lifecycle. Regular reviews and updates are essential as new threats and best practices emerge.
