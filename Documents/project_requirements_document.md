# Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

The Brand2Stand POP Display Design Automation App is a web application that helps brands and designers quickly create photorealistic mock-ups of Point-of-Purchase (POP) display stands. Instead of manually crafting designs in modeling tools, users fill out a simple form with brand, product, and stand specifications. The app then turns those inputs into optimized AI prompts, uses Fal.ai’s Imagen 4 to generate lifelike images, and lets users preview, download, or refine their designs.

We’re building this to speed up the prototyping process, reduce design costs, and empower non-technical users to visualize professional display stands in minutes. Success means users can sign up, complete a design cycle (input → generate → download) in under 5 minutes, store unlimited projects, and achieve at least an 80% satisfaction rate on image relevance and quality.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope (Version 1.0)
- User sign-up, login, and session management via Supabase (including Google OAuth).  
- Form interface for brand, product, and stand details (type, materials, dimensions, design notes).  
- Automatic prompt generation logic based on form inputs.  
- Optional prompt enhancement using OpenAI’s GPT-4o-mini.  
- Photorealistic image generation through Fal.ai’s Imagen 4 API.  
- Image gallery with preview, download, and “re-edit” via new prompts.  
- Project CRUD: create, save, load, duplicate, delete (stored in Supabase).  
- Responsive UI built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide React icons.  

### Out-of-Scope (Phase 2+)
- Multi-user collaboration or real-time editing.  
- Advanced in-browser image editing (filters, drawing).  
- Analytics dashboard or usage reporting.  
- Mobile-only or offline mode.  
- Custom user roles or admin panel.  
- Integration with other AI image providers beyond Fal.ai.

## 3. User Flow

A new user lands on the Brand2Stand homepage and is prompted to sign up or log in via Supabase (email/password or Google). After authentication, they arrive at their project dashboard, which lists existing designs and offers a “New Project” button. Clicking this opens a detailed form where they enter brand name, target audience, product type, stand style (floor, counter), materials, dimensions, and any special design notes.

Once the form is submitted, the app displays an automatically generated text prompt. The user can tweak it or click “Enhance with AI” to let GPT-4o-mini refine it for clarity and style. Hitting “Generate Images” sends the prompt to Fal.ai’s Imagen 4 model. Generated images appear in a gallery view where users can zoom in, download, or choose “Re-Edit” to apply a new prompt. At any point, users can save their project (inputs, prompts, results), load past projects, duplicate for variations, or delete unwanted ones.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

- **Frontend**  
  • React (component-based UI)  
  • TypeScript (static typing)  
  • Vite (fast dev server & build)  
  • Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)  
  • Lucide React (SVG icon components)  

- **Backend / APIs**  
  • Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime)  
  • Fal.ai (Imagen 4 for image generation)  
  • OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (prompt enhancement)  

- **Development Tools**  
  • Bolt (project scaffolding with best practices)  
  • ESLint (code linting)  
  • PostCSS (CSS transformations)  
  • tsconfig.json (TypeScript compiler setup)  

- **IDE / Plugins** (optional)  
  • Cursor or Windsurf for AI-assisted coding

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**  
  • Prompt enhancement response time < 2 s  
  • Initial UI load < 1 s on 3G  
  • Image generation end-to-end < 10 s per prompt  

- **Security**  
  • HTTPS for all API calls  
  • JWT sessions managed by Supabase  
  • Least-privilege database rules in Supabase  

- **Usability**  
  • Clear form labels and tooltips  
  • Accessible contrast ratios (WCAG 2.1 AA)  
  • Mobile-friendly layout  

- **Scalability**  
  • Support 100+ concurrent users with queued image requests  
  • Horizontal scaling of frontend and retry logic for API calls  

- **Maintainability**  
  • Modular code (services, components)  
  • Comprehensive ESLint rules and TypeScript types

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

- Fal.ai’s Imagen 4 and OpenAI GPT-4o-mini APIs must be available and within rate limits.  
- Supabase free tier limits (row counts, bandwidth) will suffice for MVP testing.  
- Users have modern browsers with JavaScript enabled.  
- Network latency may vary; plan for retry/backoff.  
- No on-premise hosting—app runs in cloud (Vercel, Netlify, etc.).  

---

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

- **API Rate Limits**: Fal.ai or OpenAI throttling may cause delays.  
  • Mitigation: show clear “retry” UI, implement exponential backoff.  

- **Prompt Quality Variance**: Some form inputs may lead to vague AI prompts.  
  • Mitigation: provide examples, enforce minimum field lengths, highlight missing context.  

- **Large Image Payloads**: Downloading high-res images could be slow on mobile.  
  • Mitigation: offer multiple resolutions, lazy-load gallery.  

- **Data Loss Risk**: Uncaught errors during save/load may corrupt projects.  
  • Mitigation: auto-save drafts periodically, confirm before destructive actions.  

- **Cross-Browser CSS Quirks**: Tailwind utilities may render differently.  
  • Mitigation: test on major browsers, include fallback styles.
